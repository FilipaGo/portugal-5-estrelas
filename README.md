## Summary

5 Estrelas (Five Stars) is a mobile app that lets users get to **know Portugal Cinco Estrelasâ€™ prize winners (Five Stars Portugal) per region and typology**, as well as take advantage of exclusive discounts from several Cinco Estrelasâ€™ brands.

Portugal Cinco Estrelas is a system that measures the consumersâ€™ satisfaction regarding Portuguese products and services through 5 criteria that mirror the variables which influence the purchase decision â€” overall satisfaction evaluation, quality/price ratio, purchase intention, brand trust, innovation.

The 5 Estrelas app showcases the most relevant national icons in terms of natural resources, monuments, gastronomy and so on, elected through a survey by the Portuguese people and a strict expert evaluation. Thus, the app helps high-quality Portugal Cinco Estrelasâ€™ winners reach a broader audience.

In this project **I handled the interaction design, user interface design (for iOS), prototyping, developer handoff** and quality assessment.
