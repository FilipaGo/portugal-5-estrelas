## Summary

5 Estrelas (Five Stars) is a mobile app that lets users get to **know Portugal Cinco Estrelas’ prize winners (Five Stars Portugal) per region and typology**, as well as take advantage of exclusive discounts from several Cinco Estrelas’ brands.

Portugal Cinco Estrelas is a system that measures the consumers’ satisfaction regarding Portuguese products and services through 5 criteria that mirror the variables which influence the purchase decision — overall satisfaction evaluation, quality/price ratio, purchase intention, brand trust, innovation.

The 5 Estrelas app showcases the most relevant national icons in terms of natural resources, monuments, gastronomy and so on, elected through a survey by the Portuguese people and a strict expert evaluation. Thus, the app helps high-quality Portugal Cinco Estrelas’ winners reach a broader audience.

In this project **I handled the interaction design, user interface design (for iOS), prototyping, developer handoff** and quality assessment.

## Step 1 — Stakeholder Interview

The stakeholder interviews were the first step I took for gathering information about the product I would be working on. These were vital for understanding the clients’ goals and expectations and served as a starting point for further actions.

</p>

During these first talks, I used sketching as a starting point to outline the product’s design.

The initial sketches served as an early collaboration tool between the team and the stakeholders but also helped ensure that what would eventually be designed could actually be built.

The stakeholder interviews also helped set up the data that could show up in the product detail screens (you can [check the document here]( https://github.com/FilipaGo/portugal-5-estrelas/blob/master/_docs_readme/info-product-detail_data.pdf)).

</p>

From that list, we established which data should be presented for each type of product (by category). You can [check the “templates” here]( https://github.com/FilipaGo/portugal-5-estrelas/raw/master/_docs_readme/info_product-detail.xlsx).

## Step 2 — Information Architecture

The insights gathered during the interviews were crucial for setting up the base [information architecture](https://github.com/FilipaGo/portugal-5-estrelas/raw/master/_docs_readme/information-architecture.png "Download the information architecture") that guided my work throughout this project.

Even though the product was fairly simple, visualising its whole structure early on was very important to clearly scope the MVP.

## Step 3 — Wireflows

<br></br>
</p>

I designed high-fidelity wireflows with real content to clearly show how the screens would flow and fit together in the final product.

This also helped stakeholders “see” the app before I got to the visual design stage, saving them a lot of time and money (time and budget constraints were tight for this project).

The high-fidelity wireframes let me work through many design details before getting into the visual design and helped stakeholders provide more constructive feedback during design reviews.

Overflow was my tool of choice to present the wireflows to the client in a more realistic and engaging way; almost like telling a story.

I worked with several boards to minimize the complexity of the diagrams: a complete user flow that illustrates all the product’s flows and smaller, more digestible diagrams, that refer to specific sub-flows and therefore are easier to read.

You can [check all the wireflows here](https://overflow.io/s/83A4JH/ "Overflow diagrams").

## Step 4 — Style Guides

</p>

Before jumping into the mockups I designed style guides to make sure things were kept consistent throughout the design and development phases.

I used Sketch to build a large and flexible symbols library to guide the whole team. (🙏🏻 nested symbols…)
