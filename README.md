## Summary

5 Estrelas (Five Stars) is a mobile app that lets users get to **know Portugal Cinco Estrelas’ prize winners (Five Stars Portugal) per region and typology**, as well as take advantage of exclusive discounts from several Cinco Estrelas’ brands.

Portugal Cinco Estrelas is a system that measures the consumers’ satisfaction regarding Portuguese products and services through 5 criteria that mirror the variables which influence the purchase decision — overall satisfaction evaluation, quality/price ratio, purchase intention, brand trust, innovation.

The 5 Estrelas app showcases the most relevant national icons in terms of natural resources, monuments, gastronomy and so on, elected through a survey by the Portuguese people and a strict expert evaluation. Thus, the app helps high-quality Portugal Cinco Estrelas’ winners reach a broader audience.

In this project **I handled the interaction design, user interface design (for iOS), prototyping, developer handoff** and quality assessment.

## Step 1 — Stakeholder Interview

The stakeholder interviews were the first step I took for gathering information about the product I would be working on. These were vital for understanding the clients’ goals and expectations and served as a starting point for further actions.

During these first talks, I used sketching as a starting point to outline the product’s design.

The initial sketches served as an early collaboration tool between the team and the stakeholders but also helped ensure that what would eventually be designed could actually be built.

The stakeholder interviews also helped set up the data that could show up in the product detail screens (you can [check the document here]( https://github.com/FilipaGo/portugal-5-estrelas/blob/master/_docs_readme/info-product-detail_data.pdf)).

From that list, we established which data should be presented for each type of product (by category). You can [check the “templates” here]( https://github.com/FilipaGo/portugal-5-estrelas/raw/master/_docs_readme/info_product-detail.xlsx).
